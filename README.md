* This is my personal project where I'am trying to simulate real softwer-tester work.
* I allowed myself to use MrBuggy7 application as a testing base for this project. This app is provided for free and everybody can download and install it to check his skills.
* MrBuggy7 is a desktop application which was released for testing competition purpouse.
* I have created Test Plan, Test Suits and Test cases for MrBuggy7. I didn't focused on overall testing. I prepared just a small part of a documentation of cases.
