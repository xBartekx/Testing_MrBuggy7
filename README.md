* This is my personal project where I am trying to simulate real software-tester work.
* I allowed myself to use the MrBuggy7 application as a testing base for this project. This app is provided for free and everybody can download and install it to check his skills.
* MrBuggy7 is a desktop application that was released for testing competition purposes.
* I have created a Test Plan, Test Suits, and Test cases for MrBuggy7. There will be also a bug report. Like everybody nowadays I don't have much time so I didn't focus on overall testing.
  I prepared just a small part of the documentation of cases because I am not working on this project - I am learning and improving my testing skills
* All documentation is in the Polish language
